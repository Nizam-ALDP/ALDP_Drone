Littering is a major environmental concern, with waste such as plastic covers, tin cans, and wrappers being carelessly discarded on streets.
The accumulation of such litter not only degrades the visual appeal of public spaces but also contributes to environmental pollution.
The impact extends beyond humans; animals and birds often mistake waste for food, leading to injuries or death and disrupting the natural ecosystem. 
The current waste management process is largely manual, requiring considerable human effort and time.
This project aims to address these issues by automating litter detection and collection, promoting a cleaner environment and supporting a healthier ecosystem for all living beings.
